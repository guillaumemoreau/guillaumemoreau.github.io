I am professor in Computer Science at Ecole Centrale Nantes, in France. My research interests are Virtual Augmented Reality, within the [AAU](http://aau.archi.fr) lab. I am also member of the [INRIA Hybrid](https://team.inria.fr/hybrid/) team.

Before this, I obtained an engineering degree in Computer Science in 1995 from [ENSIEE](http://www.ensiee.fr). As a civil servant from [ENS Rennes](http://www.ens-rennes.fr) I did my PhD studies at [IRISA](http://www.irisa.fr) lab where I graduated in 1998. After my *industrial* postdoc in the same team, I obtained a position at [Mines Paris](http://www.mines-paristech.fr) (1999-2002). Eventually I moved to [Centrale Nantes](http://www.ec-nantes.fr) as an Associate Professor in 2002. I became full professor in 2011 after obtaining my HDR in 2009.

From 2006 to 2012, I served as the CIO (Chief Information Officer) of Centrale Nantes. Then I became the head of the Computer Science and Mathematics Department until 2016 when I was appointed as the Dean of Studies, position I have occupied until the end of 2019.
