This PhD position is framed in the context of the [SEED Cofund program of IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/seed). Extreme conditions of spatial missions (Moon or Mars) will lead to a number of remotely controlled operations of rovers, especially for exploratory and construction activities. In these conditions, environmental sensing will likely be achieved through on board cameras and positioning systems. Inside a rover, interfaces based on an XR environment could be implemented to ensure consistent situational awareness for the human operator. 

The position is jointly offered by IMT Atlantique and the University of Adelaide.
