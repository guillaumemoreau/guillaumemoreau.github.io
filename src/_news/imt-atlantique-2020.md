That's indeed big news. After 18 fantastic years at [Centrale Nantes](http://www.ec-nantes.fr), I will be moving to [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr), Brest campus on Dec. 1st, 2020. I will still be a professor in Computer Science but I will also serve as Deputy Dean for Research and Innovation. Due to the pandemic, I will start in Home Office mode, but I am looking forward to moving to Brest as soon as possible. Last but not least, my research will take place at [Lab-STICC](https://www.labsticc.fr/en/index/).
