Abstract: 

Virtual reality consists of immersing users in a virtual environment (VE) and allowing them to interact in real time with the content of it. In this VE, users can be represented by a virtual body called an avatar and feel this avatar to be their own body. This is called virtual embodiment (VEmb), characterised by three components: the senses of self-location (SoSL), agency (SoA), and body ownership (SoBO). VEmb can alter the perception of a user's body or their behaviour. However, the evaluation of VEmb is complicated, being a subjective phenomenon. The current consensus is to use standardised questionnaires, but these can only be conducted retrospectively and not continuously, and forces users to perform an additional task. 
This thesis focuses on two areas. The first is the study of the interaction between the components of VEmb. Indeed, it is not yet clear how the three components interact with each other or whether one component is more important than the others. In a user study, we try to manipulate each component independently to allow a better evaluation of VEmb. This study paves the way for future experiments.
The second axis is the search for neurophysiological markers of the SoA using electroencephalography (EEG). By analysing EEG signals from Jeunet et al. 2018, we try to obtain a real-time assessment of this feeling as an alternative to questionnaires.
